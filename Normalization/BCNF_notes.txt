In the above table, student_id and subject together form the primary key because using student_id and subject; you can determine all the table columns.

Another important point to be noted here is that one professor teaches only one subject, but one subject may have two professors.

Which exhibit there is a dependency between subject and professor, i.e. subject depends on the professor's name.

The table is in 1st Normal form as all the column names are unique, all values are atomic, and all the values stored in a particular column are of the same domain.

The table also satisfies the 2nd Normal Form, as there is no Partial Dependency.

And, there is no Transitive Dependency; hence, the table also satisfies the 3rd Normal Form.

This table follows all the Normal forms except the Boyce Codd Normal Form.

As you can see stuid, and subject forms the primary key, which means the subject attribute is a prime attribute.

However, there exists yet another dependency - professor â†’ subject.
